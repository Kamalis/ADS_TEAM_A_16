The proposed smart parking system revolutionizes traditional parking methods by leveraging IoT technology and a minimalistic setup of two IR sensors, one at the entrance and one at the exit. These IR sensors efficiently detect the presence of vehicles as they enter and leave the parking area. When a car enters, the entrance sensor triggers the system to update the central database, indicating that a spot is occupied. Similarly, when a vehicle exits, the exit sensor signals the system to mark the spot as available again. The central database continually updates the status of parking slots based on this real-time information.
To benefit users, an LCD display strategically positioned at the parking lot entrance showcases the current availability of parking spots. This display communicates the number of vacant slots, guiding drivers to easily identify open spaces without the hassle of searching. This straightforward approach reduces congestion and frustration associated with finding parking, enhancing the overall parking experience.
By employing only two IR sensors and an intuitive LCD display, this smart parking system optimizes resources, minimizes infrastructure requirements, and offers a user-friendly solution. Its simplicity combined with IoT technology delivers real-time parking information, transforming the parking landscape and making urban parking more efficient and convenient for all.
